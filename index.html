                  A printed version of the Terms of Service and of any notice given in electronic
                  form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based
                  upon or relating to the Terms of Service to the same extent and subject
                  to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally
                  generated and maintained in printed form. You and DLS agree that any cause
                  of action arising out of or related to the Mobile App must commence within
                  one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of
                  action is permanently barred. The Terms of Service shall be governed by
                  and construed in accordance with the laws of British Columbia, Canada,
                  without regard for its conﬂicts of law rules. For all purposes of this
                  Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
                  courts located in Vancouver, British Columbia. This Agreement shall not
                  be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
                  Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. Any translation
                  of this Agreement which may be done is for local requirements only and
                  in the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English versions,
                  the English version of this Agreement shall govern, to the extent not prohibited
                  by local law in your jurisdiction.

                  DLS does not collect or retain any personally identiﬁable information
                  from you or from your use of the Mobile App. DLS does not collect Internet
                  “cookies” (small ﬁles that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping

                  Note, however, third party Internet sites and services through which you
                  accessed the Mobile App have separate privacy and data collection practices,
                  independent of us. DLS has no responsibility or liability for these independent
                  policies or actions. Please be careful and responsible online. If you post

              </p>
              <p>
                  The Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and DLS with
                  respect to the Mobile App, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications
                  and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and DLS
                  with respect to the Mobile App. If any provision of the Terms of Service
                  is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited
                  or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Service
                  will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure
                  of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein
                  shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. The Terms
                  of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable or transferable
                  by you except with DLS’s prior written consent. DLS may assign, transfer
                  or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent.
                  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created
                  as a result of the Terms of Service and neither party has any authority
                  of any kind to bind the other in any respect. All notices under the Terms
                  of Service will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given
                  when receipt is electronically conﬁrmed, if transmitted by e-mail.
